			<h2>Life as a Native Hawaiian</h2>
			<p>For many native Hawaiians, life is intricately connected to the land, or 'aina. The 'aina is not simply a resource to be used for material gain, but a source of identity and spirituality that is central to the culture and way of life of the Hawaiian people. Despite this deep connection to the land, however, many native Hawaiians have faced significant challenges over the years.</p>

			<p> The overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, the annexation of Hawaii by the United States in 1898, and the subsequent displacement of many native Hawaiians from their land have all had a profound impact on the community.
			Today, native Hawaiians continue to face a range of social and economic issues, including high rates of poverty, poor health outcomes, and a lack of affordable housing. Despite these challenges, however, many native Hawaiians are working to revitalize their cultural traditions and to build stronger communities that are rooted in a deep sense of connection to the land and to each other.</p>
